This is a chat application built with React. 
To run the application on your machine, please install the necessary dependencies by running the command "npm install" in your NPM environment.

The application presents a functional user interface designed for multi-party conversations. It utilizes the Scaledrone API service, which simplifies the implementation of chat functionalities. Each open tab in your web browser represents a single user with a randomly generated unique username from two predefined word pools. The maximum number of simultaneous users is set to 20, and the daily message limit is 100,000. Feel free to engage in conversations!
